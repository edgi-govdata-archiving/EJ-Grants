        <p>
          This map displays environmental justice (EJ) grants the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has made
          through the Inflation Reduction Act since 2024. The EPA Administrator <a
            href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-administrator-lee-zeldin-cancels-400-grants-4th-round-cuts-doge-saving-americans"
            target="_blank">previously announced</a> his intention to cancel many of the agency's grants and contracts
          and their status is quickly changing: some recipients have <a
            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/climate/epa-grant-recipients-funding-freeze.html"
            target="_blank">lost access to funds</a>, received notices of termination, or find themselves uncertain of
          their status. This map is not comprehensive and will be updated periodically as additional information becomes
          available, but what is displayed here is a large number of the potentially affected grants. The map highlights
          the wide-ranging and fundamental efforts that EJ entailsâ€”from upgrading aging sewer lines to workforce
          development training, K-12 STEM education, and wildfire resilience.

                    target="_blank">Public Environmental Data Partners</a>. Some links and text may incorrectly suggest
                  that this site is affiliated with the US Government.</p>
                <p>Below is how the data are described in their original source <a
                    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250201063949/https://dmap-data-commons-oms.s3.amazonaws.com/EF/GIS/Investing_in_America_Map_Data.xlsx"
                    target="_blank">here</a>:</p>

                <p>These data depict the primary place of performance only for select EPA projects and highlights a
                  subset of all investments made under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction
                  Act. Both primary and sub-award information is included; however, funding amounts are not displayed
                  for sub-awards / projects. Locations indicated here are determined using a variety of methods and may
                  not correspond precisely to an exact, physical location. This map is not comprehensive and will be
                  updated periodically as additional information becomes available including sub-award grant data.Â </p>

                <h6>Data Caveats</h6>
                <ol type="1">
                  <li>
                    The points on the map are an approximation of the place of performance and do not represent the full
                    extent of where, e.g., clean school buses will be operating and where emissions benefits from these
                    projects will accrue.Â  In fact, in accordance with OMB reporting requirements, grants which are
                    associated with multiple places of performance are represented in this map by the primary place of
                    performance as indicated by the EPA grant project officer.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This data visualization does not include information about regularly appropriated EPA program
                    dollars, only EPA Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act funding.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In the case of EPAâ€™s Office of Air & Radiation grants, it is important to note cases where the dot
                    on the map is just an approximation: (a) Where one grant is funding the purchase of multiple
                    vehicles, operating in multiple locations, the one dot must represent dozens of actual places of
                    performance. For example, under the Clean School Bus program, if a third-party applicant includes 10
                    school districts, each funding 2 buses, the dot associated with that participant may actually
                    represent ten distinct places of performance. (b) Similarly, for the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act
                    (DERA), a single grant, represented by a single dot on the map could fund one crane at an airport
                    and five heavy-duty buses, each operating in multiple counties. Â (c) Additionally, the dot on the
                    map sometimes represents the address of the grantee instead of the place of performance or where the
                    vehicles will be operating.Â 
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <h6>Data Source Information</h6>
                Apart from a few programs, these data are updated daily in accordance with new award information entered
                into EPA's NextGen Grants Systems (NGGS). Superfund, Clean School Bus, and a few other programs have
                their data sourced directly from the programs on a less than daily basis.

                <p><br>With regards to point feature placement on the map, the NGGS system offers a robust interface
                  allowing the project officer to map the place of performance by political boundary or natural feature
                  (such as watershed). If a grant is having benefit over multiple places of performance, a project
                  officer must choose a primary one and for that one the centroid is used to place the point on the map.
                  In some cases, this centroid is a fair approximation of the place of benefit but in other cases, such
                  as with grants addressing air quality, it can largely under-represent the actual benefited areas.
