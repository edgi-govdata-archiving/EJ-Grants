Specifically, the recipient s Climate Resilience Cohort initiative will provide subgrants and with the support of County and City staff, each participant CBO will: (1 ) conduct two community engagement events with their constituents to inform the Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plan; (2) participate in six Cohort staff roundtable meetings to provide feedback on the Plan; and (3 ) implement two a community-centered projects identified in the Plan (individually or with other CBOs), along with two progress meetings with the Cohort staff roundtable.


Activities:
The activities to be performed within The City Of Charlottesville and Albemarle County will include: a) reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in their communities; b) adaptation to a changing climate and c) the continuous building of a climate-resilient community. The Climate Resilience Cohort (Cohort) project seeks to achieve the following results: 1) strengthen relationships between government and community-based organizations (CBOs); 2) create a Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plan that centers equity and the experiences of underserved communities and vulnerable populations; 3) create opportunities for the City Of Charlottesville and Albemarle County to partner with CBOs in the implementation of strategies to build resilience to climate change impacts; 4) foster greater disaster preparedness among vulnerable populations and 5) equip CBOs with skills to address climate disruption in their work. Vulnerable populations will benefit from these results in three primary ways. First, stronger relationships between government and CBOs will enable more meaningful participation in climate adaptation and resilience planning and a final plan with strategies that connect to people and rsquo;s lived experience. Second, creating a plan that centers equity and meaningfully integrates the perspectives of vulnerable populations benefits the whole community. Integrating equity into climate action planning is good for everyone in the community.

Specifically, the recipient will determine if waste heat can be used to efficiently dry large quantities of seaweed. The objectives are to 1) establish a temporary structure that uses waste heat from a diesel power plant to dry seaweed efficiently, 2) identify long-term options for processing and assess business viability, 3) build acceptance or social license for mariculture and 4) provide training to increase the mariculture workforce. These objectives will provide dedicated capacity and directly support mariculture industry growth for Prince William Sound and coastal Alaskan communities. The Prince William Sound is located in southcentral Alaska and is home to five communities, Chenega, Cordova, Tatitlek, Valdez, and Whittier. Their economy is disproportionately affected by environmental issues because of their dependence upon commercial salmon fisheries. Since 2016, Prince William Sound has experienced five fisheries disasters, drastic population declines, that have affected all five salmon species native to this region. The COVID-19 pandemic added to economic strain and food insecurity by disrupting supply chains that provide 95% of Alaska and rsquo;s food. The State of Alaska and the Prince William Sound Economic Development District have identified the mariculture industry to increase economic diversity and food security. Prince William Sound currently holds 26% of Alaska and rsquo;s seaweed farm permits and thousands of pounds of kelp is harvested each year. However, there is no dedicated capacity to process seaweed. This is a barrier that prevents growth of an industry that can increase economic diversity and food security, which the objectives of this project will address. 


Activities:
The activities include: establishing a temporary structure for drying seaweed using waste heat from a power plant; drying locally grown seaweed; quantifying drying times, rates, heating needs and labor hours necessary for adequate drying; analyzing the data; holding regular stakeholder meetings; reassessing and optimizing drying efficiency; building social license for kelp farming; evaluating scalability and long-term solutions; assessing business viability; training current a prospective kelp farmers about kelp processing; and disseminating results

The recipient will provide access, skills, and resources for people to grow healthy food in the community and regenerate urban green spaces. DUG is proposing to provide the Dig Deeper Initiative (DDI) in targeted West Denver neighborhoods to achieve the following public health and environmental benefits, address environmental justice issues and achieve community health and sustainability.

Environmental benefits of this project are to 1) Decrease urban heat island in neighborhoods with some of the city and rsquo;s lowest tree equity scores through the DUG Food Forest Initiative which brings fruit bearing trees and perennials to existing community gardens, new gardens, vacant lots, park space, and community partner space; 2) Increase carbon sequestration capacity of community gardens and other greenspaces within the targeted neighborhoods to improve overall air quality; 3) Decrease greenhouse gas emissions in the targeted area by increasing local food options, thereby decreasing food miles required for residents to obtain fresh, healthy foods. 4) Water benefits which are especially critical in Denver and rsquo;s high desert climate - community gardens and food forests use significantly less water than turf and provide greater water retention in healthy soil.

Public Health benefits of this project will benefit residents of the six neighborhoods included in the project. According to the EPA and rsquo;s EJ-Screen, more than 60% of residents in these neighborhoods identify as Black, Indigenous, or a Person of Color (BIPOC), and more than 70% of households have low and/or limited incomes. For residents who engage with gardens and food forests, expected benefits include 1) Increase physical health indicators including: amount of fruits and vegetables consumed, levels of physical activity, and amount of fiber consumed; 2) Increase mental health indicators including levels of self-reported feelings of happiness, connection and wellbeing, and reduction in stress, depression and anxiety; 3) Increase access to fresh, healthy, local, seasonal food; and 4) Increase resident leadership, advocacy capacity, and connectedness to address issues of food access and environmental justice.



Activities:
The activities include supporting the cultivation of over thirty-four acres of urban land including sites in six of the seven counties within the Denver metro area. Within its network, DUG gardeners grow over 650,000 pounds of produce every year, with 10% or 65,000 pounds of this yield being donated through food pantries and other food security focused organizations. Through DUG and rsquo;s signature community garden program, DUG manages the land use agreement with the land holders (in a few cases DUG owns the land outright), while providing the following supports that ensure that gardens and gardeners can thrive and produce optimal yields of fresh local foods while strengthening community. DUG is incorporating fruit trees and other edible perennials into its current garden landscapes to provide a greater range of food access as well as tree canopy that supports the diversity of vegetation in the area while sequestering carbon and decreasing the urban heat island effect. For the DDI, DUG will recruit GLP members who are residents of the targeted neighborhoods, ensuring that there is resident representation in the program while providing an opportunity for re-skilling or up-skilling to engage in different fields of work to address limited employment opportunities in the area.

96214024,9/24/2024,This project seeks to build an outreach network of grassroots EJ organizations and other stakeholders to educate residents about EJ issues and to provide a blueprint for government processes.,"This agreement provides funding under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to the New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance. This agreement supports the recipient s project to establish the New Jersey EJ Education Collaborative. and nbsp; The project aims to provide training in EJ and enhance the capacity of EJ communities, empowering residents to engage in and nbsp;public discourse on issues affecting them. Through the project, residents will be and nbsp;educated on how to advocate for their community and rsquo;s best interests in discussions and nbsp;with government and private entities regarding and nbsp;siting, permitting and other decisions affecting their environment. These communities are historically difficult to reach, engage and organize, which is why grassroots organizations are critical to this mission. The NJ EJ Law requires enhanced public engagement for residents in EJ communities, allowing them to demonstrate local impact and have permits denied. This has accelerated the need to train EJ Communities so they can effectively influence this democratic process.

The NJ EJ Education Collaborative will address these issues by the development of a NJ-specific hub-and-spoke outreach network to community adults and youth. It will create and provide EJ basic information on issues such as air quality, water quality, toxins, solid waste and other environmental issues effecting human health and provide a blueprint for navigating governmental processes. This will help demystify the core issues for participants and give them skills to substantively promote their community and rsquo;s interests. This complements the EPA WE ACT TCTAC grant in which NJEJA is a partner and extends its capacity with deeper outreach to vulnerable communities.  and nbsp;
 

Activities:
The activities to be performed include identifying 4-5 additional organizations per geographic area to join one of several EJ hubs for the NJ EJ Education Collaborative. Digital and physical outreach materials will be created, partner organizations will hold informational meetings, and the project will coordinate with TCTACS. Quarterly hub meetings will be convened with regional hub leaders. Other activities include developing communications timelines, creating a credential model (CEUs) for participants, planning a youth content advisory group, tracking financial and non-financial data, and organizing the Summer at Kean program for student engagement. NJDEP will refine the curriculum and plan to incorporate its Summer Youth Inclusion program into modules. NJDEP will also retool educational content and pilot the curriculum with a hub leader seminar. The project will be officially launched on social media and on individual hub leaders  websites, with participant groups highlighted through an ongoing social media campaign. The Communications Manager will film each module, hub leaders will solicit feedback from participants, and findings will be consulted with hub leaders. Additionally, EJ seminars will be convened.

Outcomes:
Expected outcomes and outputs are the development of a NJ-specific hub-and-spoke outreach network, the NJ EJ Collaborative. It will create and provide to the public EJ information and a blueprint for navigating governmental process. The project will result in an expanded statewide network of EJ groups and individuals and increase the number of participants from OBCs who are aware of and adept at how to engage on NJ environmental justice issues. Specifically, the NJ EJ Collaborative will result in a) 3-6 Organizations per hub- for a total of 10 members per hub, b) Four EJ tours/ Four Seminars, c) 15 - 40 individuals will complete one curriculum module, d) 1-40 individuals who complete the full curriculum and graduate/are certified, and  e) 1-10 individuals from each regional hub who have completed at least one curriculum module.

This project will enable the Town of Bluff (ToB) and Utah Din and eacute; Bik and eacute;yah (UDB), an Indigenous-led non-profit organization, to operationalize a model partnership and rejuvenate the jointly owned Cooperative Cultural Center building (CCC) located at 630 E Black Locust Avenue in Bluff. The CCC building was constructed in phases beginning in the 1950s and used as an elementary school until 2018. The property was purchased by the ToB and UDB on October 8, 2021, to create an inclusive space in which to promote public health, safety, welfare, economic development, conduct town business, and to host non-profit activities including Native American arts and cultural programs. 

Due to the age of the building, it requires extensive renovations including the installation of a fire suppression sprinkler system, encapsulation of approximately 2,500 square feet of asbestos floor tile and mastic, and installation of insulation throughout the currently un-insulated building. Main systems such as the HVAC and electrical will also be inspected, repaired, and replaced to ensure the building is ready for use by both Town of Bluff and Utah Din and eacute; Bik and eacute;yah. Non-profit, community-based organization Utah Din and eacute; Bik and eacute;yah will use statutory subaward funds to renovate portions of the building to create office space, an entrance, reception area, art gallery, and a conference center. Pass-through funding will also support purchasing of office furnishings.  

Throughout the renovation process, we are committed to using environmentally conscientious materials and systems to ensure long-term sustainability of the building. This includes readying the building for future-planned solar power. Our community-based non-profit partner will utilize passthrough funding to ready the building for their programs, with specific renovations designed to improve the space for a conference center, offices, and reception areas. 

While many of the listed renovations will create the physical space in which the organizations will operate, the overarching goal of the building is to create an inclusive space for the community and to expand capacity for UDB and other partners to carry-out their missions.

The activities will establish a co-managed plan among four the Wabanaki Tribes as a consortium. The Penobscot Indian Nation will be the grantee and manage the grant. The consortium will establish criteria for receiving a heat pump to ensure units with the greatest need are addressed. The contract implementation will be equally divided as sub-awards, due to the geographical distance between the four Tribes of the Wabanaki Alliance. This spreads the management and funding amongst four Tribes and helps to ensure that heat pumps will be deployed to the households with the greatest need. Each Tribe s program manager will be responsible for reporting the program evaluation and submitting data to the Penobscot Indian Nation for compilation and collaboration. A property needs assessment and site visit will be incorporated in the application process. This provides an opportunity for the program manager to identify additional needs to be addressed within the home. This needs assessment will also help determine the size of the heat pump that is needed for the home. This is crucial to maintaining a budget while installing the most heat pumps in homes. Each Tribe will manage an open bidding process that will engage qualified vendors to install the heat pumps in the selected homes. The procurement process will include Native preference to increase access to contracts for Tribal citizens. Contracts will be bundled by Tribe and will vary depending on the Tribe. The Wabanaki Alliance will be working with efficiency Maine to maximize the various incentives, rebates, and tax credits available for heat pumps. This program is expected to install at least 45 heat pumps per Tribe, depending on incentives and contractor bids. The Wabanaki Consortium will hold quarterly meetings to coordinate for this program, and to develop the renewable energy technician training, the resident or tenant maintenance training, and the outreach materials for homeowners.

Outcomes:
The anticipated deliverables include up to 180 Heat Pumps Installed, a minimum of six Wabanaki Housing Circle Meetings, a reduction of 73,500 gallons of heating oil for the region, and 10 Tribal citizens certified as renewable energy technicians. The expected outcomes are divided into short, intermediate, and long-term outcomes. The expected short-term outcomes are a reduction in heating oil consumed, a transition to more renewable heating source, increase in employment potential for 10 Tribal citizens, and increased awareness of climate resilience. The intermediate outcomes are improved air quality, continued workforce development in renewable energy, increased capacity of each Tribe to manage renewable energy, changes to personal practice to incorporate more sustainable behavior. The long-term outcomes include advancing sovereignty, reducing carbon footprint, increasing energy self-sufficiency and independence, and",PENOBSCOT INDIAN NATION,IRA,Primary,Awarded,00A01184,1000000,Penobscot Nation,,,Penobscot County,ME,45.044456,-68.66501,66.312,Environmental Justice Government-to-Government,https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/environmental-justice-government-government-program,,1/31/2025,00A01184-0,Indian Tribe,"$1,000,000.00","$1,000,000.00",R01,IRA,EJG2G,

00E03859,9/27/2024,Cuyahoga County Solar for Schools G2G 2024,"Opportunities for distributed solar energy abound on residential, commercial, and government properties. As we seek to reduce our reliance on polluting fossil fuel sources, the deployment of distributed solar among these sectors has become a valuable strategy in our nation and rsquo;s energy transition. When considering the associated community benefits, however, one sector of society arguably benefits most  and ndash; the educational sector. Schools, like other institutions, businesses, and homes, experience long-term financial benefits when solar technology is adopted, but the case for solar on school properties becomes particularly compelling when associated educational opportunities are considered. This is especially true in low income and minority communities where schools are often under resourced and where access to clean, renewable energy is often unavailable.

This Solar for Schools initiative will provide financial support to five Northeast Ohio school districts in environmental justice communities to collectively install between 600  and ndash; 800 kW of solar, will create a procurement framework for future solar installations, and will support the development of renewable energy curriculum for K-12 science and high school career tech students.

The goals of this program are to: reduce electricity costs for schools; reduce regional greenhouse gas emissions; increase equitable access to clean, local renewable energy; provide educational and career tech opportunities for K-12 students; and create a replicable procurement model.

The project will produce lasting outcomes by demonstrating the environmental, educational, and financial benefits of solar, by creating a  and ldquo;solar footprint and rdquo; that can be built upon, and by developing a standard procurement process that can be replicated in the future.

Activities:
(1) The request for proposal (RFP) Development and Issuance: Solar United Neighbors will work collaboratively with the Ohio Schools Council and the IBEW Local 38 to develop the solar installer RFP. The RFP will include living wage rate and apprenticeship requirements as well as DEI considerations. Respondents will be asked to describe their past efforts with regard to hiring and promoting diverse employees and implementing equitable policies and programs.

(2) Installer Selection: The Ohio Schools Council will work with representatives from each district and the IBEW to select a solar installer. Applicants will be evaluated based on pricing, equipment, and warranty offerings as well as employee diversity, competitive wages for employees, and fair hiring practices. Preference will be given to an installer with a local presence that utilizes a local workforce.

(3) Installation  and amp; Interconnection: Solar arrays will be installed on selected schools within the five partner districts.

(4) Ongoing Monitoring: Solar United Neighbors and Cuyahoga County will work with the local school districts to monitor solar energy production, carbon emissions reductions, and electricity bill savings throughout the duration of the grant.

98T89301,11/26/2024,Inflation Reduction Act - Environmental Justice Government-to-Government,"The Copper Corridor and rsquo;s environmental injustices stem from historic mining activities and an archaic mining tax structure that benefits more populated communities in Arizona instead of those directly affected by mining. The Copper Corridor includes communities in south central Arizona, specifically southern Gila County and eastern Pinal County. Historic mining and smelting operations have deposited lead, arsenic, and other heavy metals in residential and industrial yards throughout the Copper Corridor, contaminated surface waters, and created non-attainment areas due to sulfur dioxide and lead in the air. The boom and bust of historic mining have left properties with convoluted titles that sit idle and deteriorate to the point buildings are blighted and become a hinderance to the community. The blight is not only unsightly but creates additional health burdens on already burdened communities. Gila County and its partners will use grant funds to tackle blight through a Mining Tax Distribution Study, using funds for non-hazardous cleanups, asbestos and lead surveys and abatements, demolition, public outreach and engagement and helping communities use their  and lsquo;Clean and Lien and rsquo; programs to create a revolving fund to address blight and create a model program that can be replicated in other rural Arizona communities.

By training the trainer and equipping them with opportunities for self-efficacy and data driven advocacy, this program enables educators to address pressing environmental and climate issues within their classrooms and communities, ultimately creating a ripple effect of change throughout Tennessee by advocating for systemic change at local and state levels. Recognizing that disadvantaged communities are disproportionately affected by climate change and environmental injustice, Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool data was used to identify key areas with the largest populations of these groups. 

Activities:
The Affecting Communities Through Educator Voices program is designed to have three modules for participants to achieve their goal of community participation in governmental decision-making processes related to environmental and civil rights. Environmental Justice Education Unit, Community Led Action Unit, and Capstone Project milestones and learnings from a combination of each module will be incorporated throughout each session to help participants develop a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. The academic programming for the Affecting Communities Through Educator Voices program will be divided in multiple sessions both in person and virtual. The sessions will take place on weekends during the school year to provide flexibility for participants. They will be scheduled throughout the year, giving participants a deeper understanding of the units and how they can be applied to create community change and awareness. 

Outcomes:
The anticipated deliverables include the development of an adaptable and transferable training curriculum for use across states; community members being trained for active and engaging government participation; and community members being trained for environmental justice collaboration and data driven, community led action. The expected outcomes include the development of a toolkit for environmental justice advocacy, increased access to government entities on matters relating to Environmental Justice, and the tracking of educator progress through engagement surveys and outreach activities. This program aims to prioritize these areas of greatest need, each of which has populations exceeding 50,000, in counties accounting for 28.86% of Tennesseans living in disadvantaged communities with Hamilton County representing East Tennessee, Davidson County representing Middle Tennessee, and Shelby County representing West Tennessee.

This vision will be accomplished through both a Pollution Reduction Strategy and a Climate Action Strategy. The Pollution Reduction Strategy will consolidate the Pajaro, Sunny Mesa, and Springfield water systems into one more resilient drinking water system operated by Pajaro Sunny Mesa Community Services District. The combined system will supply safe drinking water and lay the groundwork for consolidation of private well households around Springfield with the combined system in a second phase of the project.

This assistance agreement provides full federal funding in the amount of $20,000,000. See terms and conditions.


Activities:
Through this project, the Community Water Center (CWC) and its statutory partner Pajaro Sunny Mesa Community Services District (PSMCSD) will implement a drinking water consolidation project resulting in safe and reliable drinking water for the Pajaro, Sunny Mesa and Springfield water systems. The consolidation project will include construction of an iron and manganese treatment facility for Pajaro Well No. 1, upgrades to the Pajaro Well No. 1 site to reduce vulnerability to flooding, a pump station to pump water from the Pajaro to the Sunny Mesa system, rehabilitation of the Pajaro tank, and pipelines to connect the three systems. The consolidation project will also include the implementation of a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system and radio-read meters to allow for efficient operation of the resulting combined system. In addition to the consolidation project, CWC will implement residential rainwater catchment at 30 households and laundry-to-landscape greywater reuse at 20 households. Throughout the project, CWC will continue to outreach to and engage community members in the drinking water consolidation project, residential water efficiency measures, and efforts to sustainably manage groundwater resources in the area. Outreach and engagement will include at least 12 community meetings, one-on-one engagement with at least 80 community members per quarter, and development and distribution of at least 12 informational materials. In addition to project implementation, CWC will manage the overall project, coordinate with project partners, and provide progress reports as required by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA 

Outcomes:
The project will provide a safe, resilient, and affordable water supply to an estimated 5,170 Disadvantaged Unincorporated Community 
 (DUC) residents served by the resulting combined Pajaro-Sunny Mesa-Springfield system. Residents currently served by the Sunny Mesa system will no longer have unsafe levels of chrome-6 in their drinking water, and will not need to depend on bottled water with its associated greenhouse gas emissions. The combined system with SCADA and radio-read meters will be more efficient, easier to operate, and less vulnerable to flooding. The consolidation will also put infrastructure in place for consolidation of 88 private well households in the next phase of the project, which will reduce exposure to multiple primary drinking water contaminants and improve community health. In addition to the drinking water consolidation, an estimated 590,000 gallons of groundwater extraction will be avoided per year as a result of the installation of rainwater catchment and laundry-to-landscape systems. Outreach and engagement throughout the projects will ensure residents are informed regarding their drinking water supply and potential water conservation strategies and are empowered to advocate for sustainable groundwater management to protect their drinking water supply.

Research Triangle Institute (RTI) International has been selected to serve as the EPA Region 4 and National-Central Grantmaker providing support to communities across EPA Regions 4-7, with a dedicated focus on EPA Region 7. RTI s diverse team brings expertise in grant management, environmental science, environmental justice, equity and #8208;centered research and evaluation.  and nbsp;RTI s proposed solution advances racial equity by positioning community members, as part of a Community Advisory Board (CAB), as decision makers in selecting sub awardees and subgrantees. RTI s process includes targeted outreach and recruitment strategies inclusive and accessible to potential applicants in various modalities, and culturally appropriate to reach communities. RTI International will support the infrastructure to quickly launch an applications intake, review, and award process that is significantly simplified from current federal grants processes. RTI International will receive an initial award of $25,000,000 of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding to stand-up the infrastructure to support communities directly, as well as support the Regional Grantmakers in the Central Regions and the EJ TCGM network as a whole.  and nbsp;Once the infrastructure is established, RTI International will receive a subsequent award of $75,000,000 to implement subgranting programs in EPA Regions 4 and EPA Regions 7, as well as to provide support to the EJ TCGM network as a whole.  and nbsp;This bifurcated awards process is being implemented by EPA to ensure that the Grantmakers have sufficient time to establish the necessary grantmaking infrastructure before beginning to issue subgrants. The EJ TCGM program is a key lever to advance environmental justice and improve public health in communities across the central regions while ensuring that community members can shape the process.

Activities:
RTI International and its partners will come together to serve as the Region 4 and National-Central Grantmakers. Activities to be performed during this project are:

1) RTI will work, in consultation with EPA regional leaders and community representatives, to identify and engage three (3) new statutory partners located within Region 7 to ensure TCGM provides direct support to communities within the region. 

2) RTI International will implement the community-engaged transformative governance model to support the type of decision-making that acknowledges that community organizations have the authority to define success for their projects, decide on the type of interventions they most need, and contribute to the grantmaking process. The community advisory boards (CABs) are the cornerstone of the program. While applications will be accepted on a rolling basis, CABs will meet to make funding decisions on a quarterly basis. They are also charged with guiding the program implementation within the regions.  In consultation with EPA regional leaders, TCGM partners, and community member input, RTI will develop selection criteria to select Community Advisory Board (CAB) members. RTI will work closely to ensure that selection for CAB members considers contextual equity considerations so that the TCGM program can serve those communities that it is intended to benefit.

84084201,,RTI Thriving Communities Grantmaker: Subsequent Award,"Research Triangle institute (RTI) will utilize the Subsequent Award totaling $95,000,000 in EJ TCGM funding to serve as one of eleven Grantmaker organizations that are charged with implementing the program. RTI will serve in the capacity of a National Grantmaker (Central Regions) as well as the provision of direct assistance to Regions 4 and Region 7.  RTI will implement and deploy federal financial assistance to instill resilience to underserved communities inclusive of Regions 4, 5, 6 and 7.

This funding is the latter half of the bifurcated award that will be used for passthrough grantmaking activities authorized under CAA 138(b  The RTI National Grantmaker (Central Regions) will be funded by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) appropriations at the level totaling $120 million and divided into two awards. The Initial Award of $25 million was made in August 2024 and the subsequent award of $95 million is slated for December 2024. The bifurcated award is sourced from the same funding but will maintain separate but overlapping timelines to meet the overall components of the award. The Subsequent Award includes award competition, selection and distribution of funds, capacity building and technical assistance for Regional Grantmakers and subrecipients, participatory governance and outreach efforts that will support the regional Grantmakers in 4,5,6, and 7 as well as addressing coverage gaps that they may have difficulty reaching. Gaps include, but is not limited to, remote and/or rural areas of the U.S. Territories and parts of the contiguous United States. 

OEJECR has also provided additional within-scope supplemental funding for each Grantmaker to address  Quality Assurance (QA), Human Subjects Review (HSR), as well as provide funding for additional meaningful outreach and gap filling to remote, rural and hard-to-reach areas of the country, and territories that must be adjusted due to elevated travel costs. Supplemental funds total  $20M of the $95 million and will be used to support the successful distribution and completion projects funded under the subawards.
It should be noted that the Initial Award enabled the Grantmaker to perform the tasks needed to plan and implement proposed participatory governance, outreach, and system mobilization efforts that established the criteria for the collection, review, selection, and distribution of the EJ Thriving Communities Subawards. The pass-through model developed by EPA is central to the new approach, as it  allows the Grantmakers to distribute smaller subawards to community-based organizations (CBOs) more efficiently than the traditional federal grants process. This model will endeavor to ensure that underserved communities can access funds more quickly and with fewer administrative burdens. The work previously conducted under the Environmental Justice Small Grants program will be managed by Grantmakers while allowing EPA to focus on assessment, planning, and project development.

RTI has extensive experience in grantmaking and providing technical support for equity-centered approaches that build collaborative environmentally based outcomes and will endeavor to ensure that EPA funds under the Thriving Community Grantmaker Program are managed and distributed to communities that are most in need of addressing health and environmental challenges. By increasing funding access and reducing administrative barriers, the EPA aims to empower disadvantaged communities to address long-standing environmental justice challenges. This approach aligns with the goals of Executive Orders 13985 and 14008, which prioritize equitable access to federal resources and emphasizes the need for inclusive decision-making processes that advance environmental justice nationwide.
