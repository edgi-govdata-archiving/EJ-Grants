2,1,1,107,4,4,,07-16-2024,Research Triangle Institute (RTI) - Grantmaker - Initial Award,"The purpose of the Environmental Protection Agency s (EPA) Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program ( EJ TCGM ) is to transform disadvantaged and underserved communities into healthy, thriving places that can address the health and environmental challenges they face now and into the future.  and nbsp;EPA will do this by using a pass-through model to distribute grant funds to communities via multiple Grantmakers serving communities across the nation. Research Triangle Institute (RTI) International has been selected to serve as the EPA Region 4 and National-Central Grantmaker providing support to communities across EPA Regions 4-7, with a dedicated focus on EPA Region 7. RTI s diverse team brings expertise in grant management, environmental science, environmental justice, equity and #8208;centered research and evaluation.  and nbsp;RTI s proposed solution advances racial equity by positioning community members, as part of a Community Advisory Board (CAB), as decision makers in selecting sub awardees and subgrantees. RTI s process includes targeted outreach and recruitment strategies inclusive and accessible to potential applicants in various modalities, and culturally appropriate to reach communities. RTI International will support the infrastructure to quickly launch an applications intake, review, and award process that is significantly simplified from current federal grants processes. RTI International will receive an initial award of $25,000,000 of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding to stand-up the infrastructure to support communities directly, as well as support the Regional Grantmakers in the Central Regions and the EJ TCGM network as a whole.  and nbsp;Once the infrastructure is established, RTI International will receive a subsequent award of $75,000,000 to implement subgranting programs in EPA Regions 4 and EPA Regions 7, as well as to provide support to the EJ TCGM network as a whole.  and nbsp;This bifurcated awards process is being implemented by EPA to ensure that the Grantmakers have sufficient time to establish the necessary grantmaking infrastructure before beginning to issue subgrants. The EJ TCGM program is a key lever to advance environmental justice and improve public health in communities across the central regions while ensuring that community members can shape the process.

Activities:
RTI International and its partners will come together to serve as the Region 4 and National-Central Grantmakers. Activities to be performed during this project are:

1) RTI will work, in consultation with EPA regional leaders and community representatives, to identify and engage three (3) new statutory partners located within Region 7 to ensure TCGM provides direct support to communities within the region. 

2) RTI International will implement the community-engaged transformative governance model to support the type of decision-making that acknowledges that community organizations have the authority to define success for their projects, decide on the type of interventions they most need, and contribute to the grantmaking process. The community advisory boards (CABs) are the cornerstone of the program. While applications will be accepted on a rolling basis, CABs will meet to make funding decisions on a quarterly basis. They are also charged with guiding the program implementation within the regions.  In consultation with EPA regional leaders, TCGM partners, and community member input, RTI will develop selection criteria to select Community Advisory Board (CAB) members. RTI will work closely to ensure that selection for CAB members considers contextual equity considerations so that the TCGM program can serve those communities that it is intended to benefit.

3,1,1,250,4,4,,01-08-2025,RTI Thriving Communities Grantmaker: Subsequent Award,"Research Triangle institute (RTI) will utilize the Subsequent Award totaling $95,000,000 in EJ TCGM funding to serve as one of eleven Grantmaker organizations that are charged with implementing the program. RTI will serve in the capacity of a National Grantmaker (Central Regions) as well as the provision of direct assistance to Regions 4 and Region 7.  RTI will implement and deploy federal financial assistance to instill resilience to underserved communities inclusive of Regions 4, 5, 6 and 7.

This funding is the latter half of the bifurcated award that will be used for passthrough grantmaking activities authorized under CAA 138(b  The RTI National Grantmaker (Central Regions) will be funded by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) appropriations at the level totaling $120 million and divided into two awards. The Initial Award of $25 million was made in August 2024 and the subsequent award of $95 million is slated for December 2024. The bifurcated award is sourced from the same funding but will maintain separate but overlapping timelines to meet the overall components of the award. The Subsequent Award includes award competition, selection and distribution of funds, capacity building and technical assistance for Regional Grantmakers and subrecipients, participatory governance and outreach efforts that will support the regional Grantmakers in 4,5,6, and 7 as well as addressing coverage gaps that they may have difficulty reaching. Gaps include, but is not limited to, remote and/or rural areas of the U.S. Territories and parts of the contiguous United States. 

OEJECR has also provided additional within-scope supplemental funding for each Grantmaker to address  Quality Assurance (QA), Human Subjects Review (HSR), as well as provide funding for additional meaningful outreach and gap filling to remote, rural and hard-to-reach areas of the country, and territories that must be adjusted due to elevated travel costs. Supplemental funds total  $20M of the $95 million and will be used to support the successful distribution and completion projects funded under the subawards.
It should be noted that the Initial Award enabled the Grantmaker to perform the tasks needed to plan and implement proposed participatory governance, outreach, and system mobilization efforts that established the criteria for the collection, review, selection, and distribution of the EJ Thriving Communities Subawards. The pass-through model developed by EPA is central to the new approach, as it  allows the Grantmakers to distribute smaller subawards to community-based organizations (CBOs) more efficiently than the traditional federal grants process. This model will endeavor to ensure that underserved communities can access funds more quickly and with fewer administrative burdens. The work previously conducted under the Environmental Justice Small Grants program will be managed by Grantmakers while allowing EPA to focus on assessment, planning, and project development.

RTI has extensive experience in grantmaking and providing technical support for equity-centered approaches that build collaborative environmentally based outcomes and will endeavor to ensure that EPA funds under the Thriving Community Grantmaker Program are managed and distributed to communities that are most in need of addressing health and environmental challenges. By increasing funding access and reducing administrative barriers, the EPA aims to empower disadvantaged communities to address long-standing environmental justice challenges. This approach aligns with the goals of Executive Orders 13985 and 14008, which prioritize equitable access to federal resources and emphasizes the need for inclusive decision-making processes that advance environmental justice nationwide.
