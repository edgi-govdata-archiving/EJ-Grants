# EJ-Grants

 This map displays environmental justice (EJ) grants the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has made through the Inflation Reduction Act since 2024. The EPA Administrator previously [announced(https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-administrator-lee-zeldin-cancels-400-grants-4th-round-cuts-doge-saving-americans) his intention to cancel many of the agency's grants and contracts and their status is quickly changing: some recipients have [lost access to funds](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/climate/epa-grant-recipients-funding-freeze.html), received notices of termination, or find themselves uncertain of their status. This map is not comprehensive and will be updated periodically as additional information becomes available, but what is displayed here is a large number of the potentially affected grants. The map highlights the wide-ranging and fundamental efforts that EJ entailsâ€”from upgrading aging sewer lines to workforce development training, K-12 STEM education, and wildfire resilience.
