# EJ-Grants

This is a map displaying environmental justice grants the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) made under the Inflation Reduction Act since 2024. The original data source for the map is archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20250201063949/https://dmap-data-commons-oms.s3.amazonaws.com/EF/GIS/Investing_in_America_Map_Data.xlsx). The map is not comprehensive and will be updated periodically as additional information becomes available. It is hosted by EDGI and the [Public Environmental Data Partners](https://www.screening-tools.com).

As of March 2025, the EPA and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have moved to retract many EPA grants and contracts. See [here](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/administrator-zeldin-terminates-biden-harris-20b-gold-bar-grants) and [here](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-administrator-lee-zeldin-cancels-400-grants-4th-round-cuts-doge-saving-americans). This has left awardees without the ability to [fulfill their contractual obligations](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/climate/epa-grant-recipients-funding-freeze.html). At the same time, the EPA has removed information about its grants from its [website](https://enviro.epa.gov/envirofacts/nggs/search) and DOGE likewise doesn't share information about [which grants it has cut](https://doge.gov/savings) (only saying that "descriptions are forthcoming"). While an archive of the Biden administration's invest.gov map of IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) awardees is available [here](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/invest/), it was only last updated before Trump's inauguration and so is missing records updated since Trump's second term started.

Our map aims to fill these information gaps, illustrating the most current record of environmental justice grants made by the EPA under the IRA. A more comprehensive record of grants made by EPA, including ones under various EJ programs, is still available from the EPA [here](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?url=https://geopub.epa.gov/ArcGIS/rest/services/EMEF/EPA_Grants/MapServer&source=sd) but these records haven't been updated since March 2020.
